            "\n",
            "1. **Explain the concept of decorators in Python and provide an example of how they can be used to enhance code functionality.**\n",
            "   - Decorators are powerful tools in Python that allow developers to modify the behavior of functions or classes without changing their source code.\n",
            "   - They are commonly used to add functionality such as logging, caching, or performance profiling to existing code.\n",
            "   - Understanding decorators demonstrates a developer's grasp of advanced Python concepts and their ability to write maintainable and extensible code.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Discuss the differences between lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python, highlighting their key characteristics and appropriate use cases.**\n",
            "   - Python offers various data structures, and understanding the distinctions between lists, tuples, and dictionaries is crucial for effective data management.\n",
            "   - Lists are mutable sequences, tuples are immutable sequences, and dictionaries are key-value pairs.\n",
            "   - Choosing the appropriate data structure for a specific task showcases a developer's understanding of Python's data structures and their ability to optimize code performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.**\n",
            "   - OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm widely used in Python.\n",
            "   - Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods together into objects, inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and methods from parent classes, and polymorphism enables objects to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
            "   - Proficiency in OOP principles demonstrates a developer's ability to structure code effectively, promote code reusability, and enhance maintainability.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Describe the purpose and usage of the 'with' statement in Python, emphasizing its role in resource management and exception handling.**\n",
            "   - The 'with' statement is a powerful tool in Python for managing resources and handling exceptions in a concise and efficient manner.\n",
